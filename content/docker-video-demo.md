Summary: A video of demo of docker and docker-compose using Python, Flask, and MongoDB.

I recently began exploring docker as a solution for isolating development and production environments. I have used vagrant and virtual machines for awhile but like the potential upside of docker. The following video tutorial guides a user from scratch in the creation of a docker containerized flask application connected to mongodb. Enjoy!
